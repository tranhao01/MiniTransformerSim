# Examples

This folder contains example scripts demonstrating how to run the mini transformer simulation and accompanying utilities.

## Running the simulation

The main simulation script is located at the repository root:

```bash
python mini_transformer_simulation.py
```

It will print sample predictions and generate three attention heatmaps.

## Fibonacci examples

The script `fibonacci_demo.py` shows a simple example unrelated to Transformersâ€”it prints the first 10 Fibonacci numbers and is used by the test suite.

The script `fibonacci_chart.py` generates and saves a chart of Fibonacci growth:

```bash
python fibonacci_chart.py
```

After running, the image will be saved as `fibonacci_chart.png`.
